# RetNSyn: Byte-Level Hybrid of Phi-3.5 and RetNet

RetNSyn is an experimental framework that reconfigures Phi-3.5 into a byte-level language model while integrating RetNet-inspired mechanisms. This approach empowers the model to interpret and generate across universal file types via direct byte-stream processing.

## Key Features:

1. **Byte-Level Operation**: Works directly on raw bytes, allowing compatibility with any digital format.
2. **RetNet Integration**: Embeds RetNetâ€™s multi-scale decay and group normalization for efficient long-range information handling.
3. **Dual-Mode Execution**: Offers both parallelized training and recurrent inference capabilities.
4. **Targeted Fine-Tuning**: Selectively updates certain components (like embeddings or normalization layers) while maintaining the integrity of core Phi-3.5 weights.
5. **Low-Rank Weight Adaptation (DoRA)**: Applies DoRA to self-attention projections to optimize adaptation without disrupting pretrained representations.

## Implementation Strategy:

- **Weight Preservation**: Keeps most of the pretrained Phi-3.5 parameters frozen to retain base linguistic priors.
- **Flexible DoRA Mapping**: Allows customization of where and how low-rank adaptation is applied.
- **Architectural Configurability**: Enables toggling between standard attention and retention-based modules.
- **Untied Embeddings Support**: Permits separate embeddings for input and output layers.

## Training and Inference:

- Implements efficient training cycles with adjustable scheduling strategies.
- Supports initialization from scratch or fine-tuning existing checkpoints.
- Includes a text generation pipeline for inference and completion.

## Goals:

- Investigate retention mechanisms within byte-level model architectures.
- Merge recurrent and parallel modes for optimal efficiency.
- Establish a unified system capable of processing all data formats.

Note: This is a research-focused prototype, serving exploratory and developmental purposes rather than production. It highlights the synergy of pretrained models and adaptive fine-tuning within hybrid architectures.
